        My name is Moises Gutierrez and I am enrolled in the University of California, Santa Barbara, as a 2nd year computer engineering major. This website will give you a greater understanding of who I am and what I wish to accomplish in the future, furthermore, it will give you a personal insight on who I am outside of my academics!

        As a student, hobbies and sports keep me entertained and busy, and some things I enjoy are playing soccer, doing house repairs, and hanging out with coworkers and friends. You can learn more about my hobbies and interests in my Fun page!
